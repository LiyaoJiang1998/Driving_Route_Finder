Assignment1 Part2

---------------------------------------------------------------
Description:

For this part of the assignment, we updated the server side of the
program. So it uses Serial port to communicate with Arduino Client

Receives two pairs of (lat,lon) as start and end point from client

It will find the nearest start and end vertex.
And using Dikstra's to find the least-cost-path.

It will then send back the waypoints coordinates of the path
to the client.

The Arduino Client side was implemented in this part.
We implemented the communication part and the storing of waypoint
number and waypoints.

The program sends Request after getting start and end from the user.
And write to Serial to the server.This program use the protocol given.
So when it gets all the waypoints from the server, it will draw the path
and wait for the user's next selection. After the path is drawn, the 
path will be redrawn when you move the map around or zoom.

Files in the zip and where to look:

README - this file

Server:(python program)
	The main server file:
		server.py (We wrote originally)

	List of files(We created from part 1):
		load_edmonton_graph.py
		costdistance.py
		least_cost_path.py

	List of files(Implemented in class):
		binary_heap.py(deleted the visualization part)
		breadth_first_search.py
		graph.py

Other files needed not in the zip:
	edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt

Make sure you have all the file listed above
in the same directory!

Client:(Arduino C++ program)
	The main client file:
		client.cpp (provided template by instructor)
		(Only the places commented Original and TODO
		is wrote by us)

	List of files(Implemented in class):
	 - Makefile
	 - client.cpp
	 - consts_and_types.h
	 - lcd_image.h and .cpp
	 - map_drawing.h and .cpp


Make sure you have all the file listed above
in the same directory!

---------------------------------------------------------------
Wiring needed for this part 2 of Assignment1 !

NOTE: In addition to this wiring you also have to download the .lcd files
from eClass and put them on your SD card (after unzipping them).

TFT Display:

    The display pins are numbered left to right in this document when they are being viewed
    with their labels showing rightside up. Note you do not require the touchscreen for this assignment,
    so it is probably a lot easier to not wire the Y+/X+/Y-/X- pins.

    Display Pin     Arduino Mega Pin
    1 GND           BB GND bus
    2 Vin           BB Vcc (+ive) bus

    4 CLK           Pin 52
    5 MISO          Pin 50
    6 MOSI          Pin 51
    7 CS            Pin 10
    8 D/C           Pin 9

    19 CCS          Pin 6

Zoom in and out buttons:

    Button          Arduino Mega Pin
    Zoom In         Pin 2
    Zoom Out        Pin 3

Joystick connections:

    Joystick Pin    Arduino Mega Pin
    +5v             Vcc
    GND             GND
    VRx             Analog 1
    VRy             Analog 0
    SW              Pin 8


---------------------------------------------------------------
Running instruction:

server side:
	direct into the server folder
	run the server.py as main program by
	using  python3 server.py command in terminal
	
client side:
	direct into the client folder
	connect your arduino to computer and make uplaod
	the client program

Keep the server side terminal running
and move cursor and select start and end point by joystick

After selected start and end
the route will be drawed on display shortly

Use the Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons to adjust zoom level
